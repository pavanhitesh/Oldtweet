	#Calculate Billing Details field on Sales Order is not checked when an order is completed in the community, resulting in blank "To:" section in financial documents
	#
	#This is possibly the same issue as [https://fonteva.atlassian.net/browse/PD-26656|https://fonteva.atlassian.net/browse/PD-26656] and [https://fonteva.atlassian.net/browse/PD-26657,|https://fonteva.atlassian.net/browse/PD-26657,] but I have reproduced the bug behavior in 21Winter.0.10 and 20Spring.1.19 GCOs with the custom metadata for updateBillingAddress configured and enabled, per this page of release notes - [https://docs.fonteva.com/releases/Update-Billing-Address-Metadata.2862416016.html|https://docs.fonteva.com/releases/Update-Billing-Address-Metadata.2862416016.html].
	#
	#h2. Steps to Reproduce
	#
	#1. Log into community as a contact with Mailing Address populated but no Known Addresses
	#2. Navigate to the Store and purchase a generic item without shipping or tax
	#3. Complete payment with Credit Card without entering an address

	#
	#h2. Expected Results
	#
	#Sales Order's Calculate Billing Details field is checked. Billing Contact and Address fields are populated on Sales Order and Receipt.
	#
	#* The billing contact text field on the SO should be populated with whoever is paying the order (Contact lookup on the receipt).
	#* Remember maybe Contact A, pays Contact Bâ€™s Sales Order, on that case
	#** SO Contact lookup = Contact A
	#** SO Billing Contact (Text field) = Contact B
	#** Receipt contact lookup = Contact B
	#
	#h2. Actual Results
	#
	#Sales Order's Calculate Billing Details field is unchecked, resulting in the Billing Contact and Billing Address fields not being populated. As a result, Billing Contact and Billing Address fields are also missing from Receipt. Financial documents' "To: " sections are blank
	#
	#h2. Business Justification
	#
	#Missing data from financial records and member-facing documents.
